# Semantic-Fast-SAM
SSA + FastSAM \
I'm inspired by FastSAM that higly faster than sam but sustains sam's performance succesfully.
(obviously, there are few Degraded performance, but still efficient i think)
this Semantic-Fast-SAM is also inspired by Semantic-Segment-Anything(i.e.,SSA). but change main segmentation branch, SAM(vit-h) to FastSAM(YOLOv8-seg).
